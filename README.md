################# WEB CRAWLER USING PYTHON ###########################

This is a web crawler built on python during my introduction to computer science course on python
This is a simple application to run on your local machine.
It should be noted that the original and current version ignore robot.txt files and 
thus should be used cautiously, if at all, to search the open web.
